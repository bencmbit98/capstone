st.markdown(''':green[This chatbot prototype uses a **naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** \
to generate responses based on content from three external websites. \
By combining retrieval and generation, the model provides accurate, \
contextually relevant answers to user queries. \
Below is the detailed methodology for the chatbot’s development, structured in five sequential stages: \
Document Loading, Splitting & Chunking, Storage, Retrieval, and Output.]''')

st.markdown(''':orange[1. Document Loading]''')
st.markdown('''In this initial stage, the content from three specified websites is fetched \
and prepared for further processing. Using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python, \
we retrieve the HTML content of each web page, then clean and parse the text to focus \
on the relevant information.
* Fetch content from each URL using requests.
* Parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup, extracting the main text content while removing any irrelevant HTML tags and navigation elements.
* Consolidate the content from all sources into a single text corpus, which will be processed in the next stages.''')

st.markdown(''':orange[2. Splitting and Chunking]''')
st.markdown('''Given the potential length of the extracted documents, \
splitting and chunking is crucial to ensure the data fits within \
the token limits of the language model and can be effectively retrieved. \
Using LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, \
we break down the text into smaller, manageable chunks.
* Use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class to split the text into chunks, \
setting a maximum chunk size (e.g., 500 tokens) with some overlap \
between chunks to preserve context.
* Store each chunk as a Document object with metadata indicating \
the source URL and chunk position. \
This allows for traceability and retrieval of the most relevant chunks later.''')
