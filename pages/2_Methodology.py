st.markdown(''':green[This chatbot prototype uses a **naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** \
to generate responses based on content from three external websites. \
By combining retrieval and generation, the model provides accurate, \
contextually relevant answers to user queries. \
Below is the detailed methodology for the chatbotâ€™s development, structured in five sequential stages: \
Document Loading, Splitting & Chunking, Storage, Retrieval, and Output.]''')

st.markdown(''':orange[1. Document Loading]''')
st.markdown('''\
In this initial stage, the content from three specified websites is fetched \
and prepared for further processing. Using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python, \
we retrieve the HTML content of each web page, then clean and parse the text to focus \
on the relevant information.
* Fetch content from each URL using requests.
* Parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup, extracting the main text content while removing any irrelevant HTML tags and navigation elements.
* Consolidate the content from all sources into a single text corpus, which will be processed in the next stages.
